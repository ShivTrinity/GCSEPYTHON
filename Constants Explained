#Constants explained

#Constansts look a but like variales

#but constants are declared in full caps

#for example

THREEPOINTERSHOT = 3
FREETHROWS = 1

#when programmers see a constant

#it tells them not to change the value

#to display the value in the constant, the code is

print(THREEPOINTERSHOT)
